My practice pad for testing with [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [chai](https://chaijs.org/). To run the tests, simply clone the repo, and run `npm install` and `mocha app.spec.js`.

The tests can be found in app.spec.js and the code can be found in app.js.

If you would like to expand this further and have multiple tests, you can create a `spec/` folder and place all your spec.js files (*.spec.js) in it. To run the tests, simply run `mocha spec` and mocha will know to look in the spec folder for the tests
